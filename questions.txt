1. where is photoanalysisserver_images actually created?? I see microservicetemplate accessing an external volume..
2. why do both the worker and server use the same dockerfile in photo analysis server.. wouldnt worker not need uvicorn, etc?
3. so is it fine if the images are stored in a docker volume attached to the server?
