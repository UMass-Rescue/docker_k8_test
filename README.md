# Docker Test
In the main branch:
1. Download Docker
2. Run `docker-compose build` in the top-level directory
3. Run `docker-compose up` in the same directory
4. Open the server on `localhost:5000`
5. Open the microservice/client on `localhost:5001`

For the conversion to docker, see the branch `k8_conversion`, and the open pull request to see a side-by-side comaprison.
